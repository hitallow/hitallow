## Expertise ðŸš€

Passionate about learning new ways to make things work well and create sustainable and robust applications. I have dedicated five years to refining my skills in full-stack technologies, leading squads, and developing solid architectures to maintain a high standard of development and performance.

In my professional career so far, I take pride in having worked with various technologies and different stacks. Dealing with new challenges and adapting to different teams is something I do with ease. I have worked on projects involving banking applications, sales, inventory management, vehicle licensing, among others. Throughout this journey, I have had the opportunity to take on the responsibility of leading squads, ensuring efficient execution of tasks assigned to our team.

My passion for continuous learning has led me to study the combination of applications with modern frameworks, always applying design patterns to ensure solidity and efficiency.
